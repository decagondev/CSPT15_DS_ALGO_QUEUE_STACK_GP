"""
Given a string sequence consisting of the characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}'. Your task is to determine whether or not the sequence is a valid bracket sequence.

The Valid bracket sequence is defined in the following way:

An empty bracket sequence is a valid bracket sequence.
If S is a valid bracket sequence then (S), [S] and {S} are also valid.
If A and B are valid bracket sequences then AB is also valid.
Example

For sequence = "()", the output should be validBracketSequence(sequence) = true;
For sequence = "()[]{}", the output should be validBracketSequence(sequence) = true;
For sequence = "(]", the output should be validBracketSequence(sequence) = false;
For sequence = "([)]", the output should be validBracketSequence(sequence) = false;
For sequence = "{[]}", the output should be validBracketSequence(sequence) = true.

[input] string sequence

A bracket sequence, consisting of the characters (, ), [, ], {, and }.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 106.

[output] boolean

true if sequence is a valid bracket sequence and false otherwise.
